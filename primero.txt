Let me tell you something you already know

The worl ain´t all sunshine and rainbows,its a very mean and nasty place, 
and i dont care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you, 
me or nobody is going to hoy as hard as life. But it ain´t about how hard you hit, it´s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, 
how much you can take and keep moving forward. 

That´s how when it is done. Now if you know what you´re worth, 
to go out and get what you are worth,
but you got to be willing to take hits and noy poiniting fingers saying you ain´t  where you want to be because of him, or her o r anybody, cowards do that  and that ain´t you, you´re better son
